# BioInformatics for Proteins and Peptides
Written and created by Cameron Ridderikhoff

For Dr. Glen Ulrig, at the University of Alberta

To use this set of functions:

Section 1: Protein Classification
1. Find the directory in your terminal.
2. Type the command "python3 run_proteus_workflow.py". This is an automated process, but it needs information. 
3. Follow the prompts, and the workflow will run. This may take a while.
4. If it finishes and outputs ""Script passed with code: 0", you are done. 
4(a). If it finishes and outputs "Script failed with code: " and some number, there was an error running the project. Contact Glen if this happens, and tell him the error code.

Section 2: Peptide Classification.
1. Find the directory in your terminal.
2. Type the command "python3 alter_phosphorylated_protein_data.py". This will alter the peptide data file, and will then run the corresponding R script.
